class Channel;

// Base class for |ChildBinding| and |PeerBinding|, which are essentially
// pointers to |Channel|s that can be resolved late.
//
// When two objects are associated via a fidl binding, their respective channel
// accumulators can be associated using this class. An accumulator corresponding
// to the 'client' object (which has an |InterfacePtr| to the 'server' object)
// can use a |ChildBinding| or |PeerBinding| field to reference the channel (and
// therefore the accumulator) corresponding to the server object.
//
// In order for the binding to be resolved, the client channel handler must
// associate a koid with the |Binding| by calling |SetBindingKoid|. The koid
// refers to the server end, i.e. the 'related' koid extracted from the
// |InterfacePtr|. The channel handler for the server object must also associate
// the same koid with the corresponding channel by calling |BindAs|. The koid,
// again, refers to the server end, i.e. the koid extracted from the fidl
// |Binding| or |InterfaceRequest|.
//
// The distinction between a |ChildBinding| and a |PeerBinding| is that a
// |ChildBinding| establishes a parent/child relationship between the client
// and server, respectively. Consequently, there should be only one
// |ChildBinding| referencing a channel. Any number of |PeerBinding|s can
// reference a channel.
//
// Each binding has its own unique koid. Two bindings referencing the same
// channel, for example, have distinct koids. This implies that a channel can
// be 'bound as' any number of koids, one for each |Binding| that references
// it.
